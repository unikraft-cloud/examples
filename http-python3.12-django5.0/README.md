# Django

This guide explains how to create and deploy a Python Django web app.
To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Install the [`kraft` CLI tool](https://unikraft.org/docs/cli/install) and a container runtime engine, for example [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. Clone the [`examples` repository](https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples) and `cd` into the `examples/http-python3.12-django5.0/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples
cd examples/http-python3.12-django5.0/
```

Make sure to log into Unikraft Cloud by setting your token and a [metro](https://unikraft.com/docs/platform/metros) close to you.
This guide uses `fra` (Frankfurt, 🇩🇪):

```bash
export UKC_TOKEN=token
# Set metro to Frankfurt, DE
export UKC_METRO=fra
```

When done, invoke the following command to deploy this app on Unikraft Cloud:

```bash
kraft cloud deploy -p 443:80 -M 512 .
```

The output shows the instance address and other details:

```text
[●] Deployed successfully!

 ├────────── uuid: d8469447-fdf6-4caf-9fea-494218ca6f72
 ├───────── state: running
 ├─────────── url: https://dawn-sound-n5wrkxi2.fra.unikraft.app

 ├──── private ip: 172.16.6.5
 └────────── args: /usr/bin/python3 /app/main.py
```

In this case, the instance name is `http-python312-django50-vt56c` and the address is `https://dawn-sound-n5wrkxi2.fra.unikraft.app`.
They're different for each run.

Use `curl` to query the Unikraft Cloud instance of the Django web app server:

```bash
curl https://dawn-sound-n5wrkxi2.fra.unikraft.app
```
```html

<!doctype html>

<html lang="en-us" dir="ltr">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>The install worked successfully! Congratulations!</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <style>
          html {
            line-height: 1.15;
          }
          a {
            color: #19865C;
          }
[...]
```

Or point a browser at the address and/or its `/admin` area.
You can set the username and password in the `Dockerfile` (more on this file later) to `unikraft/unikraft`.

> **Caution:**
> The example sets ALLOWED_HOSTS to * and runs in debug mode.
> For a production site, ensure you read the recommended deployment guides of the official Django project.

You can list information about the instance by running:

```bash
kraft cloud instance list
```
```ansi

```

When done, you can remove the instance:

```bash
kraft cloud instance remove http-python312-django50-vt56c
```

## Customize your app

To customize the app, update the files in the repository, listed below:

* `main.py`: the entry point for the app
* `Kraftfile`: the Unikraft Cloud specification
* `Dockerfile`: the Docker-specified app filesystem

Lines in the `Kraftfile` have the following roles:

* `spec: v0.6`: The current `Kraftfile` specification version is `0.6`.

* `runtime: python:3.12`: The Unikraft runtime kernel to use is Python 3.12.

* `rootfs: ./Dockerfile`: Build the app root filesystem using the `Dockerfile`.

* `cmd: ["/usr/bin/python3", "/app/main.py"]`: Use this as the starting command of the instance.

Lines in the `Dockerfile` have the following roles:

* `FROM scratch`: Build the filesystem from the [`scratch` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/), to [create a base image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/).

The following options are available for customizing the app:

* If you only update the implementation in the `main.py` source file, you don't need to make any other changes.

* If you create any new source files, copy them into the app filesystem by using the `COPY` command in the `Dockerfile`.

* More extensive changes may require extending the `Dockerfile` ([see `Dockerfile` syntax reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)).
  This includes the use of Python frameworks and the use of `pip`, as shown in the next section.

## Using `pip`

[`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is a package manager for Python.
It's used to install dependencies for Python apps.
`pip` uses the `requirements.txt` file to list required dependencies (with versions).

The [`http-python3.12-flask3.0`](https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples/tree/main/http-python3.12-flask3.0) guide details the use of `pip` to deploy an app using the [`Flask`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) framework on Unikraft Cloud.

Run the command below to deploy the app on Unikraft Cloud:

```bash
kraft cloud deploy -p 443:80 -M 512 .
```

Differences from the Django app are also the steps required to create an `pip`-based app:

1. Add the `requirements.txt` file used by `pip`.

2. Add framework-specific source files.
   In this case, this means the `server.py` file.

3. Update the `Dockerfile` to:

   3.1. `COPY` the local files.

   3.2. `RUN` the `pip3 install` command to install dependencies.

   3.3. `COPY` of the resulting and required files (`/usr/local/lib/python3.12` and `server.py`) in the app filesystem, using the [`scratch` container](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/).

The following lists the files:

The `requirements.txt` file lists the `flask` dependency.

The `Kraftfile` is the same one used for Django.

For `Dockerfile` newly added lines have the following roles:

* `FROM python:3.12-bookworm AS base`: Use the base image of the `python:3.12-bookworm` container.
  This provides the `pip3` binary and other Python-related components.
  Name the current image `base`.

* `WORKDIR /app`: Use `/app` as working directory.
  All other commands in the `Dockerfile` run inside this directory.

* `COPY requirements.txt /app`: Copy the package configuration file to the Docker filesystem.

* `RUN pip3 install ...`: Install `pip` components listed in `requirements.txt`.

* `COPY --from=base ...`: Copy generated Python files in the new `base` image in the `scratch`-based image.

Similar actions apply to other `pip3`-based apps.
