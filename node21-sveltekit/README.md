# SvelteKit

This guide explains how to create and deploy a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) app.
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) builds on Svelte, a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser.

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. Install the [`kraft` CLI tool](https://unikraft.org/docs/cli/install) and a container runtime engine, for example [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. Clone the [`examples` repository](https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples) and `cd` into the `examples/node21-sveltekit/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples
cd examples/node21-sveltekit/
```

Make sure to log into Unikraft Cloud by setting your token and a [metro](https://unikraft.com/docs/platform/metros) close to you.
This guide uses `fra` (Frankfurt, 🇩🇪):

```bash
export UKC_TOKEN=token
# Set metro to Frankfurt, DE
export UKC_METRO=fra
```

When done, invoke the following command to deploy the app on Unikraft Cloud:

```bash
kraft cloud deploy -p 443:3000 -M 256 .
```

The output shows the instance address and other details:

```ansi
[●] Deployed successfully!

 ├────────── uuid: cd5071b0-5605-4771-b75d-4789393e60de

 ├──── private ip: 172.16.3.3
 └────────── args: /usr/bin/node /app/build/index.js
```

In this case, the instance name is `node21-sveltekit-zmt39` and the address is `https://dark-fog-z18n0ej1.fra.unikraft.app`.
They're different for each run.

Use `curl` to query the Unikraft Cloud instance:

```bash
curl https://dark-fog-z18n0ej1.fra.unikraft.app
```

```text
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
[...]
        <body data-sveltekit-preload-data="hover">
[...]
```

Or even better, point a browser at it 😀
This will get you to play with the SvelteKit demo app.

You can list information about the instance by running:

```bash
kraft cloud instance list
```

```ansi
NAME                    FQDN                                STATE    STATUS         IMAGE                                 MEMORY   VCPUS  ARGS                               BOOT TIME

```

When done, you can remove the instance:

```bash
kraft cloud instance remove node21-sveltekit-zmt39
```

## Customize your app

To customize the app, update the files in the repository.
That is, you update the SvelteKit / Node / `npm`-specific files, or the Unikraft Cloud-specific files.
This section details each below.

### Updating the app

Updating the SvelteKit app is reliant on making `npm`-related updates.

[`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager for Node.
It's used to install dependencies for Node apps.
`npm` uses a `package.json` file to list required dependencies (with versions).

[`npm create svelte@latest`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project) generated the app files, using the [`@sveltejs/adapter-node`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node) adapter.

The `src/routes/sverdle/` directory contains the core implementation.
Detailed information on updating the implementation is part of the [official SvelteKit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction).

Updates to the implementation will probably require updates to the `package.json` file.
The `package.json` file lists [`npm` app dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies).

#### Deploying locally

Before deploying the SvelteKit app on Unikraft Cloud, you can deploy locally.
Assuming `npm` is installed, use the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

```text
  VITE v5.2.6  ready in 807 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

You can test the app locally by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Sample specification

Lines in the `Kraftfile` have the following roles:

* `spec: v0.6`: The current `Kraftfile` specification version is `0.6`.

* `runtime: node:21`: The Unikraft runtime kernel to use is Node 21.

* `rootfs: ./Dockerfile`: Build the app root filesystem using the `Dockerfile`.

* `cmd: [["/usr/bin/node", "/app/build/index.js"]]`: Use `/usr/bin/node /app/build/index.js` as the starting command of the instance.

Lines in the `Dockerfile` have the following roles:

* `FROM node:21-alpine AS deps`: Use the base image of the `node:21-alpine` container.
  This provides the `npm` binary and other Node-related components.
  Name the current image `deps`.

* `WORKDIR /app`: Use `/app` as working directory.
  All other commands in the `Dockerfile` run inside this directory.

* `COPY package.json /app`: Copy the `npm` configuration file to be able to install dependencies.

* `RUN npm install`: Install `npm` components listed in `packages.json`.

* `FROM deps AS build`: Create a fresh checkpoint of the base image for the build phase.

* `COPY . /app`: Copy contents of the current directory (the actual app files) in the Docker filesystem.
  Note that paths in the `.dockerignore` file aren't copied.

* `RUN npm run build; ...`: Build the files required for running the app standalone.
  The app entry point is the resulting `/app/build/index.js` file that's used as the start command in the `Kraftfile`.
  To run the app, configure it as a module.

* `FROM scratch as prod`: Use [the `scratch` empty filesystem`](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/) as the actual runtime environment.
  It will only contain the required files from the build.

* `COPY --from=build ...`: Copy existing files from new `build` image to the `scratch`-based image.
  This means the app build directory (`/app/build`) and the required dependencies (`/app/node_modules`).

#### Customization options

It's unlikely you will have to update the `Kraftfile`.
The only potential update is the `cmd` option.
But since SvelteKit / `npm` generates the `/app/build/index.js` file, you're unlikely to update it.

You also don't need to change the `Dockerfile`.
Updates to the app would be part of the `package.json` file or the `src/` directory.
And updating these won't affect the contents of the `Dockerfile`.
Still, if required, apps may require extending the `Dockerfile` with extra [`Dockerfile` commands](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
